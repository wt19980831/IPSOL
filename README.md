# Protein Solubility Prediction
## Motivation
Protein drugs can be manufactured through recombinant proteins in the expression system. These drugs have high efficacy, low side effects and clear biological functions that can participate in and inhibit the physiological and biochemical processes of cancer cells in the human body. Therefore, protein solubility prediction is important to drug production, research and so on. A model named EL-FFsol based on the CatBoost ensemble learning framework and multiple feature fusion of protein sequences is proposed to predict protein solubility.
## Installation
