# Protein Solubility Prediction
## Motivation
The solubility of protein plays an important role in some basic scientific experiments and medical drug research because the degree of solubility can represent the quality of protein functions. A novel and highly accurate solubility predictor that combines the fusion of multiple feature information of proteins and the CatBoost algorithm in the ensemble learning to predict the solubility of proteins.
